# Cerebral Minimal Example (with React)

This project is just a minimal example of how to use [Cerebral](https://cerebraljs.com/) for managing state in JS applications.

It is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### What this is not

This is not a production quality code at all and is just for learning purposes.
